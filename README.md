A visualization of Canada from the total calorie supply CSV. Special attention is being paid to Sugar and Sweetners and their effect on Obesity rates in Covid fatalities.

- CSVs are not importing directly to the graph due to a CORS error. Data manually entered for now. When working, there will be a dropdown selector for Country and graph type (Fat supply, kcal, Quantity and protein supply) to render a visualization of relationships. 
- Categories were grouped here for ease of visualization, given the number of sub 1% data. Each Feautre will be examined individually, perhaps grouped again based off correlation.
