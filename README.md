# Global Diet, Population & Covid 19 Mortality

## Github and Communications

The first thing we did was set up a Slack channel for our group. It has been very active during its first week, and in fact, our topic was decided upon with several relevant CSV's over the Slack channel. It is a valuable communication tool and we will continue to use it.

Next, 4 branches for each group member was created along side the main branch on my Github page. Each member was to complete a markdown write up pertaining to their segment of the assignment. They will all be kept in their individual branches until we have satisfying, completed code so as to muddy up the main branch with too many commits. The only thing commited so far is a folder containing [the CSV's we will use](https://github.com/Mikeblanchard/Covid_Project/tree/main/CSVs).

The Gtihub branches are all linked here for reference: [Mike's branch](https://github.com/Mikeblanchard/Covid_Project/tree/mike), [Holly's branch](https://github.com/Mikeblanchard/Covid_Project/tree/holly), [Mariela's branch](https://github.com/Mikeblanchard/Covid_Project/tree/mariela) and [Arjun's branch](https://github.com/Mikeblanchard/Covid_Project/tree/arjun)

##### *Notes*

- CSVs are not importing directly to the graph due to a CORS error. Data manually entered for now. When working, there will be a dropdown selector for Country and graph type (Fat supply, kcal, Quantity and protein supply) to render a visualization of relationships. 
- Categories were grouped here for ease of visualization, given the number of < 1% data. Each Feautre will be examined individually, perhaps grouped again based off correlation.
