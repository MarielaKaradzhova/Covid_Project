# Global Diet, Obeisty & Covid-19 Mortality

## Machine Learning Sketch

### Primary Analysis

For this analysis, we will be using a supervised maching learning model on the Food Supply Quantity Data. We will be training two separate models for this analysis:

#### Analysis 1: Global Diet & Obeisity

_Features(X)_:
  - Alcoholic Beverages	
  - Animal Products	
  - Animal fats	
  - Aquatic Products
  - Other	Cereals - Excluding Beer	
  - Eggs	
  - Fish
  - Seafood	
  - Fruits - Excluding Wine	
  - Meat	
  - Milk - Excluding Butter	
  - Miscellaneous	Offals	
  - Oilcrops	
  - Pulses	
  - Spices	
  - Starchy Roots	Stimulants	
  - Sugar Crops	Sugar & Sweeteners	
  - Treenuts	
  - Vegetal Products	
  - Vegetable Oils	
  - Vegetables

_Target(y)_:
  - Obeisity 

#### Analysis 2: Obeisity & Covid-19 Mortality 

_Features(X)_:
  - Obesity	
  - Undernourished

_Target(y)_:
  - Deaths 

### Secondary Analysis

In this analysis we will indroduce a second dataset to the modelling
