# Global Diet, Population & Covid 19 Mortality

## Github and Communications

The first thing we did was set up a Slack channel for our group. It has been very active during its first week, and in fact, our topic was decided upon with several relevant CSV's over the Slack channel. 





The Gtihub branches are all linked here for reference: [Mike's branch](https://github.com/Mikeblanchard/Covid_Project/tree/mike),

A visualization of Canada from the total calorie supply CSV. Special attention is being paid to Sugar and Sweetners and their effect on Obesity rates in Covid fatalities.

- CSVs are not importing directly to the graph due to a CORS error. Data manually entered for now. When working, there will be a dropdown selector for Country and graph type (Fat supply, kcal, Quantity and protein supply) to render a visualization of relationships. 
- Categories were grouped here for ease of visualization, given the number of < 1% data. Each Feautre will be examined individually, perhaps grouped again based off correlation.
