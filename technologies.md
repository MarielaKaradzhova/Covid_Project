## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform the exploratory analysis for this project in Jupyter Notebook.

## Database Storage
SQLite / PostgreSQL are the two choices for database storage that we intend to use for this project. 

## Machine Learning
We intend to use Jupyter Notebook to create two separate but similar supervised machine learning models.

## Dashboard
To visualize the results of this project we are going to use HTML and D3.js (nested charts), OR Tableau to create the final dashboard.
