# Covid Project


# Technologies Used
Language: Python

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Working with Python and Jupyter Notebook, Pandas will be used to clean and organize the data for this project, and to perform our exploratory analyses.

## Database Storage
SQLite / PostgreSQL are the two choices for database storage that we intend to use for this project. 

## Machine Learning
We intend to use Jupyter Notebook to create two separate but similar supervised machine learning models for each analysis. 

*Anaysis 1:Global Diet & Obesity/ Obesity & Covid Mortality
Supervised, testing and training the dataset to use the global diet features as predictors for obesity and then obesity as a predictor for covid mortality.

*Analysis 2:Population & Obesity/ Population & Covid-19 Mortality
With the merging of Deaths.csv, we can introduce age & population as predicators of obesity and covid 19 mortality with a similar supervised machine learning model.

## Dashboard
To visualize the results of this project we are going to use HTML and D3.js (nested charts), OR Tableau to create the final dashboard.
